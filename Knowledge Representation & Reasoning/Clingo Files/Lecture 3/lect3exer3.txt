Given a KB consisting of the following rules:
    Steamboat(x) ∧ Sailboat(y) ⇒ Faster(x, y) 
    Sailboat(x) ∧ Rowboat(y) ⇒ Faster(x, y) 
    Faster (x , y ) ∧ Faster (y , z ) ⇒ Faster (x , z ) 
    Steamboat(Titanic)
    Sailboat(Mistral) 
    Rowboat(PondArrow)

Using backward chaining to prove: Faster (Titanic , PondArrow ).

Basically we want to proove, Steamboat(x) ∧ Rowboat(y) => Faster(x,y)

So we want 
                Faster(x,y)
                    |
                Faster(Titanic, PondArrow)
                |                       |
        Steamboat(Titanic)          Sailboat(PondArrow)

we have Steamboat(Titanic) but not Sailboat(PondArrow) in our facts, so discarding this.

Similarly discarding second rule for this.

                Faster(x,y)
                    |
                Faster(Titanic, PondArrow)
                |                       |
        Faster(Titanic, Z)         Faster(Z, PondArrow)
        |               |               |               |
Steamboat(Titanic)  Sailboat(Mistral)   Sailboat(Z)    Rowboat(PondArrow)
                        |               |
                        {Z/Mistral}    Sailboat(Mistral)
