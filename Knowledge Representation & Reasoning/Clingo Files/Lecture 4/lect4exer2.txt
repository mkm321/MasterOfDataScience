Consider the following program:
p(a) ← not p(b). 
p(b) ← not p(a).

*************
p(a) :- not p(b).
p(b) :- not p(a).
*************
1. Find all answer set(s) of this program. 
2. Does Π |= p(a) hold?

1. Set, S1 = {p(b)}, S2 = {p(a)}
2. since p(a) is not in all answer sets of this program. there for Π does not entail(|=) - p(a).
